# HVAC-Estimate-App

## User Story
As a customer looking to get a new HVAC unit installed. 
I want to go to a website where I can get a free estimate on a new HVAC system.
When I hit Get started then I am presented with a series of questions that are going to automatically determine what kind of unit I need and how a sales representative can contact me and set up a date for installation.
Once all questions have been answered, The app will give me a price with a detailed description of my available options and pricing.
